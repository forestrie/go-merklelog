// returns the array of mountain peaks in the MMR. This is completely
// deterministic given a valid mmr size. If the mmr size is invalid, this
// function returns nil.
//
// It is guaranteed that the peaks are listed in ascending order of position
// value.  The highest peak has the lowest position and is listed first. This is
// a consequence of the fact that the 'little' 'down range' peaks can only appear
// to the 'right' of the first perfect peak, and so on recursively.
//
// Note that as a matter of implementation convenience and efficency the peaks
// are returned as *one based positions*
//
// So given the example below, which has an mmrSize of 17, the peaks are [15, 18]
