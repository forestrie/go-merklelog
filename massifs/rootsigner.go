// confirmer, because we are allways pre-signing *peaks* of the MMR. And the
// consistency between peaks (accumulators) is the concern of the sealer by way
// of LogConfirmer. And the most natural place to store them is in the massif
// seal.  Which is what we accomodate here.
//
// It is a specific property of MMR based logs that proofs of inclusion always
// lead to an accumulator peak. This leads to the ability to pre-sign receipts
// *once* for all possible inclusion proofs in the current mmr state by simply
// singing the peak and leaving the proof empty.  Because the proofs are never
// signed, (the are attached in the unprotected header), Those can be added on
// demand in a completely trustless way.
//
// Importantly, this allows for self service *privacy preserving*, scitt
// compatible, receipts based on replicated copies of the log. The signing key
// is not required to attach the proof.
//
// Notice that, due to the Low Update Frequency property, defined in
// https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/718.pdf, *many* MMR sizes will contain the same
// peak. Over time, the signed peak for any element changes less and less
// frequently (log base 2). This means, in addition to being able to pre-sign,
// the work required of a receipt holder to check the log remains consistent
// with their old receipt gets less and less. And, in the case of a receipt
// against an unequivocal log state, completely redundant. The receipt holders
// can also significantly compress the receipt data they retain.
//
// It is true, due to low update frequency, that many may be copies of earlier
// receipts, but the locality here means consumers only need to hit one blob and
// in doing so reveal less about their area of interest.
